        **Area of Improvement:**
        The pre-commit hooks currently run `buf generate` on every push, which creates large diffs and unnecessary commits.

        **Motivation / Benefit:**
        Optimizing the code generation workflow will reduce repository noise, improve git history clarity, and speed up the development cycle.

        - **For Pre-commit:** Only run buf generate when .proto files have changed
        - **For Documentation:** Add examples of common proto patterns in a docs/ directory
        - **For CI:** Cache buf tools and dependencies to speed up GitHub Actions
