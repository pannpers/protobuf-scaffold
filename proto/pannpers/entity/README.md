# Core Entity Definitions

This package, `pannpers.entity.v1`, contains the definitions for the core business entities and their associated value objects.

These messages represent the fundamental data structures of the application, such as `User` and `Post`. They are designed to be stable and are referenced by the API services in the `pannpers.api.v1` package.

Value objects like `UserId` and `PostTitle` are used to enforce type safety and domain-specific validation rules.
