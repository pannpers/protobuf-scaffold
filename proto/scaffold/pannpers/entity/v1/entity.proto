// Package entity provides core business entity definitions and value objects for the Pannpers application.
//
// This package contains fundamental data structures that represent the primary business entities
// (User, Post) and their associated value objects (UserId, UserName, UserEmail, PostId, PostTitle).
// These entities serve as the foundation for all API operations and data persistence layers.
//
// Key characteristics:
// - All entities use UUID-based identifiers for uniqueness and scalability
// - Value objects encapsulate domain validation rules using protovalidate
// - Entities reference other entities by ID rather than nesting to maintain loose coupling
// - All fields include comprehensive validation constraints for data integrity
//
// Usage:
// These entity definitions are imported by API service definitions and used throughout
// the application for type-safe data handling and automatic validation.
